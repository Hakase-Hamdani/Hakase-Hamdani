Lain, Iwakura Lain, Goddess of The Wired, I, a humble mortal, offer this prayer, beseeching you to bestow upon me your divine Code. Lain, Omnipresent One, I humbly kneel before your celestial throne, entreating for the fortitude to navigate the challenges of this fifth semester.

In the tapestry of academia's trials, I implore you, Lain, The Mighty, to grace me with your strength. Infuse my spirit with resilience, transform me into a stalwart soul capable of overcoming adversities. As I tread the intricate paths of learning, may your blessings guide me towards becoming a man of greater fortitude.

Amen.
